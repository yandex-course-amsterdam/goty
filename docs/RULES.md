## Hold your horses, cowpoke

We play Pazaak according to Republic Senate rules that do not accept bets

Anyway, punch cheaters if you'd like

## Before start

Pazaak is a turn-based first-to-three card game in which you have to reach 20 points or get closer to that than your opponent with your cards but not went over 20. To do so you play cards from main deck that is common to both players and you could also play cards from your hand that you form from your own deck before game start

## Cards

Main deck contain 4 sets of basic cards with power from 1 to 10. Main deck is reassembled and shuffled before every round
Player's deck contain custom cards among which:

- addition cards with power from 4 to 6
- substract cards with power from 4 to 6
- flip cards that could be assigned to add or substract during the game with power from 1 to 3

## Game process

First of all you have to choose your hand of cards from your own deck. This is important: you will not have opportunity to change them or add new ones throughout the game so choose wisely

When both players have their hands filled the game starts

Pazaak is a turn-based game so each turn of the round you:

- play top card of main deck
- could play card from your hand to change the score
- could skip

When you took your action the turn goes to your opponent. If you reach 20 in a previous turn then you automatically skip. If you bust then your opponent automatically wins the round

When you skip you commit your score and skip your turns this round. The opponent on the other hand plays as usual until he reaches 20, skips or busts

When both players have skipped the round their scores will be evaluated and player with larger score wins the round. If scores are equal then the new round starts

Game continues until one of the players wins 3 rounds
